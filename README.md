This particular notebook serves purely as a means of practicing and reviewing for myself, and I have documented its contents while watching instructional videos on [Mr. P Solver](https://www.youtube.com/@MrPSolver)'s YouTube channel.

It is my aspiration that the formatting Markdown I have employed will facilitate the legibility of the notebook.

Additionally, you may peruse the notebook compiled by [Mr. P Solver](https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel).
