# Python_For_Engineers
# **Disclaimer**

This notebook is  just a practice and review notebook which I wrote down for myself while watching [Mr. P Solver](https://www.youtube.com/@MrPSolver) channel on YouTube.

It is my aspiration that the formatting Markdown I have employed will facilitate the legibility of the notebook.

You can also check [Mr. P Solver's notebook](https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel).
